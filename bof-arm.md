# BoF: ARM in HPC

## Astra

First Petascale ARM supercomputer.

Cavium Thunder x2. 28 core

Online for 2 weeks

* HPL: 1.5 Pflops max, 2 pflops peak, 203 on Top500
* HPCG: 67 Tflops, 36 on Top500

## Isambard

Simon McIntish

Production ARMv8 Supercomputer

11k cores in one cabinet

Cray with Cray software stacks


## Resource Usage

Broadly:

* Power comparison to server-class x86 is very similar
* However, much better **performance for the price**

## Challenges

* Memory bandwidth
* Compiler support is immature
* Compilation times anecdotally poor

## Cloud?

* Adoption still poor.
* "HPC doesn't exist in a vacuum." Actually a small chunk of the market,
  overall. Hoping to ride the coat tails as it is adoped in cloud.
* Hoping it'll drive price all the way down!
