## Workshop: Compiler Directives for Accelerator Programming

Intro:

* Heterogenious computing now well-established. Accelerators, heirarchical
  memory.
* Far improved performance for the power, but harder to program, hence the
  focus on programming models.
* Workshop focussed on OpenACC / OpenMP (vs CUDA / OpenCL)

Thoughts:

* For me, this workshop could have benfitted from more __raw numbers__. The
  multiple presentations were a little too anecdotal. The keynote presentation
  from DOE already hinted at this problem, where he highlighted the
