Explore How to Deploy the Unruly Power of Machine, Platform, and Crowd


Most of history boring from an economic perspective!

Didn't make any difference for the living standards of regular people.
Entirely subsistence farming.
200 years ago, living standards started taking off!
We are about 50x richer than ancestors. Unimaginable wealth.

Why? Technology. Steam engine triggered industrial revolution. Example of
"general purpose technologies" (GPT), so-called because they enable and **drive**
other inventions. Others: rail, electricity, computing.

Technology itself is not enough. It's when it leads to new ways of thinking.

Case study on factories retrofitting steam to electricity. No productivity
improvements for 30 years. About the same amount of time for management to
retire! Ultimately new management used electricity to implement "unit drive",
smaller electrical motors enabled factories to implement assembly lines.

New revolution: Machine, Platform, Crowd.

* Mind -> Machine
* Product -> Platform
* Core -> Crowd

## Mind to Machine

Previously: decisions made by debate between senior people at the company.

HiPPO: Highest Paid Person's Opinion.

Now: moving towards data-driven decisions. Companies turning to **geeks**!

Additionally: large amounts of digital data enable geeks to make good
decisions.

Data-driven-decisions measured in the census! DDD growth 3x.


Beyond that, the **First Wave** "Second Machine Age", teaching machines what we know:

* "Coding" = codifying knowledge
* Mantra = "Codify, Digitize, Replicate"
* Economics: High Fixed Cost, Low Marginal Costs

Unique enconomics of digital world: free, perfect and instant.

Limits of the First Wave:

> "We know more than we can tell." Polanyi's Paradox

**Second Wave** Machines that Learn.

* Supervised Learning for Cancer Diagnosis
* Real Estate Assessment
* NN Translation from Chinese to English
* Voice Assistants "Talking to Machines!" People would have thought we are
  insane.

## Product to Platform

Every one of the top 7 companies right now is a platform company.

Apple example in the Smartphone Space. App Platform.

Uber & Ridehailing.

Network effects.

Two-sided marketplaces.

## Core to Crowd

Crowdsourced.

Google as a crowdsourced search engine?
